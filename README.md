## Asset Management Software (Backend)

This is a repository for backend code with Django REST Framework for my masters project of Asset Management Software.

This is an application for utilizing of resources in an organization for preventing the bottlenecks. This will help in managing, scheduling and assigning the resources to the registered users. The users can schedule and plan the timings for using the resources. The application will provide the information if the resource is blocked to another user or not. This application is applicable for various kinds of resources like printers, scanners, conference rooms, auditoriums, etc.

Technologies used:
- **PostgreSQL** => Backend Database
- **Django REST Framework** => Exposing APIs
- **Djoser** => Authentication
